# KotlinSortingAnimation

This project aims to practice Kotlin. The project will do sorting on Android with animation and sound like this youtube

My idea is to compare the sorting and how each sort behave.

So in the end I plan to.
 0. Add automate testing, crashlytic etc.
 1. User can generate dummy data
 2. User can choose sorting algor
 3. There will be bubble, selection, insertion sort and the other sort will added later.
 4. Show up to 6 sorting run simultaneously to compare
 5. Summarize each sorting after run

 Future
 6. Add sound when sorting
 7. Record screen when sorting and share to social
 8. Add explanation for each sort (kind of education)
 9. Link to some learning resource about sorting
 10. Embedded ads
 11. Create a blog for this project

 Welcome for the suggestion on my code.
